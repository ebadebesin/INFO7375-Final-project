The dataset "Data_4.csv" includes data captured when falling when walking. 


The State 1 represents the time in which the fall took place.

The person was initially walking.

The data from 16600 milliseconds to 20200 milliseconds is when the actual fall took place.

After 20200 milliseconds the person was recovering from fall (recovering means the person woke up and was sitting at the same fall position)
